# Progress

Most of the functionality works, just a lot of cleaning up to do now. We also need to find a way to perform user testing (utilising a form to garner feedback). The UI could be cleaned up a little bit (especially on smaller screens).

## To-Do List

- Model Library Gallery + Texture Import
- User Testing and Feedback
- User Manual + Technical Specification
- Optimisations + Constraints/Limits

## Future Direction

Note that the features that I will mention are not a part of the scope of v1. They are nice-to-haves and could 'legitimize' our application to be something truly useful.

- User accounts (to view saved models, etc.)
- Export to cloud rendering pipeline (but this is far beyond, as it would require textures, lighting, camera features, etc, could also be performance draining).

## Note

Note that our application, as outlined in our functional specification is a tool to get beginners to step foot into the 3D creation space without the overwhelming steep learning curve of Blender / Maya, and other industry standards. This could be especially useful for kids/teenagers to learn 3D modelling, or even adults with limited technological exposure. So rather than modelling from scratch, the idea is that you can manipulate existing models to understand things.
