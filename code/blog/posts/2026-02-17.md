# ISO/IEC/IEEE 26514 User Manual Standards

We are formatting the ZenCG user manual to follow an international documentation structure based on `ISO/IEC/IEEE 26514` as it is a recognized international standard for software user documentation. It provides a structure for purpose, audience, tasks, troubleshooting, and revision control. It also makes the manual easier to maintain. Moreover, a clear structure allows for a smoother user experience, which is the point of ZenCG, to make 3D model editing accessible for beginners.
