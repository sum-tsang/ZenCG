Today, we will be maintaining / updating the user interface. We're going to clean up the UI, and focus on creating a nicer user experience. We will take an iterative approach, thus while we are developing the UI, at the same time, we will implement any features that come to mind.

Whilst we did mention using Tailwind CSS previously, what we have realised is that we would rather have full control over the minute details of the editor. As the home page and blog page are less of a priority, we will utilise Tailwind CSS for rapid prototyping. Moreover, there are Tailwind CSS templates online that can help us with these less critical aspects of the project.

## Original User Interface

Starting off today, we have a working, albeit simple interface. One of the main maxims of our project is to make 3D editing accessible and usable for beginners. The user interface control panel should be intuitive to use, whilst also reducing cognitive overload, as to not overwhelm the user. This is something that [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), and other popular 3D editors lack. That is not to say that those industry standards are actually bad... there simply are not great options for beginners to learn 3D modelling without the steep learning curve.

What will differentiate us from competitors is our **learning-based** approach. Integrated tutorials, clear controls, and a straight-forward learning curve.

Currently our user interface looks like the image below. As mentioned, it is working but simple. However, it feels visually cluttered, with a lack of clear sectioning. It seems as though functions and features are placed randomly.

## UI Wire Frames

In the images below, you'll notice that we are attempting to follow the design of our original wireframes, which are outlined in our functional specification. The control panel and outline panel are currently one cohesive panel located on the right side. The question is, how do we implement the other panels without diminishing the simplicity?

1. **Wireframe 1 (Editor Viewport)**

We want to add integrated tutorials into our application. As we also must write up a user manual, this is a feature that we can implement in parallel to the user manual write up.

## Iteration 2

- We added a navigation bar at the top, which will be useful for features like accessing the user manual, etc.
- The list of objects in the scene got added to the top, following the wireframe.
- What we will do is probably clean up the text, and make the buttons themselves clear on what action they are.
- For instance, we could add + symbol for adding models.
- However, it is already looking simpler.
- If we want to focus on simplicity, and our site is targeted toward laptops/desktops, wouldn't it be wise to keep the layout a fixed size, so the user doesn't accidentally adjust sizes, etc, and everything is easier to find?

## Iteration 3

- In the second iteration, we focused on the design rather than the layout.
- We rounded corners again, utlised blue highlighting to indicate the selected model.
- Make the list of OBJ have arrows on the left to indicate that it is a list of selectable objects.
- We added a bin icon to simplify the UI, rather than having a big delete button for each model.
- The button turns black to highlight the transform tool selected.
- Softened edges, and lighter colours to make the viewing experience better on the eyes.

### Import OBJ UI

- We simplified the import OBJ feature by adding it to the top of the list. This implies the idea of 'adding' a model to the list of OBJ, and declutters the control panel by bundling similar functions together.
