Just a brief progress update. The core features, functions, and such are complete. Small bugs may still exist as the application is in its early versions. User testing (for total beginners), led us to make our program more intuitive to use. For instance, the translate shortcut has been moved from G to T, and we introduced arrow key navigation / movement.

Right now, we are simply just cleaning up the code, doing finishing touches to the technical specification / user manual, and planning a vide demonstration.
