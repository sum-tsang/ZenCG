## Overview

#### New Features

- We implemented a basic working home page.
- We established a basic cohesive brand identity (Blue, white, black).
- We implemented a simple delete feature for models.
- We made the gizmo bigger so you can actually see it.

#### Fixes

- We fixed the gizmo, so transforming, scaling, and rotation works properly.
- Added left click to model transform (more intuitive than right click).
- Transform persistence across refresh.
- De-selection now clears the yellow box highlight.

### Model Transformation (Gizmo)

- We fixed the gizmo, where moving objects would distort the camera.
- Transforming, rotation, scaling properly works now.
- Left click drag works for transform, right click no longer needed.
- Rotate rings are back and aligned.
- Made the gizmo bigger and the arrows easier to grab.
- De-selection. Clicking empty space de-selects (and clears the highlight).

### Home Page & Blog Page

- Added a basic working home page, detailing the UVP of ZenCG.
- Added a basic colour palette (Blue, white, black).
- Prototyped utilsing Tailwind CSS for rapid prototyping.

### Model Persistence Updates (Saving)

The OBJ files would not persist transformation-wise, so we fixed this by utilising IndexedDB.

- We store the transform with each OBJ entry.
- On load, we apply it instantly.

```js
entry.transform = {
  position: object.position.toArray(),
  quaternion: object.quaternion.toArray(),
  scale: object.scale.toArray(),
};
```

```js
applyTransform(object, entry.transform);
```
