## Overview

- We removed the old toolbar header and renamed `Mode` to `Tools`.
- We fixed toolbar alignment so the toggle is centered relative to the toolbar itself.
- We aligned the `ZenCG` bar and tools styling so the colours and spacing are consistent.
- We added a centered glassmorphic footer (about 2/3 width) for undo/redo.
- We added a most recent action indicator in the footer.
- We added a live tool indicator in the footer (example: `Move | X Y Z`).
- We made the active axis highlight update live while transforming.
- We fixed the empty-state issue so `No objects imported yet` disappears after importing models.
- We added a `Combine Models` button for multi-selected models.
- We added shortcut `C` to combine selected models.
- We added duplicate flow: `Ctrl/Cmd + C` to copy, `Ctrl/Cmd + V` to paste, and `D` for instant duplicate.
- We simplified duplicate naming so names do not become long repeated copy strings.
- We added transform shortcut flow with `G`, `R`, `S` and axis locks `X`, `Y`, `Z`.
- We reduced accidental free-move behaviour to avoid unintended object movement.
- We improved persistance wiring so scene/object state is saved and restored more reliably.
- We updated the User Manual with the new shortcuts and a clearer control mapping list.
