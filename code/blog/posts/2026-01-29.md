# 29th of January 2026

## Overview

- Added a model import flow from the library and the supporting model library module.
- Introduced library assets (`base_mesh.obj`, `cube.obj`) and a `library.json` manifest.
- Split the editor app into smaller modules (config, DOM, shortcuts, state, status, store).
- Extracted model component logic into reusable `modelComponents` (e.g. split mesh by box).
- Expanded transformation tooling (gizmo/manager/panel/transform tools).
- Added persistence support (storage, save scheduling, restore).
- Built out scene features (environment gizmo, list view, placement/transform, render loop, delete/dispose, selection/context).

## Model Import (Library)

- You are now able to import models from a library of models. Currently, models are saved to `editor/assets/models`, data is contained in `library.json`.

## Model Components (Split Mesh by Box)

- Introduced a dedicated `modelComponents/splitMeshByBox.js` module to keep geometry operations reusable.
- The split logic was moved out of the transformation manager and now returns independent inside/outside meshes in world space.
- This keeps the transformation tools slimmer and makes it easier to reuse component operations elsewhere.

## Atomized JavaScript Files

- We atomized the JavaScript files for maintainability.
- Following 'KISS', 'Keep It Stupid Simple", we reduced long files into chunks.
- We moved files into relative directories.
- `app.js` wires the files together, effectively working as a checklist.

The images attached below highlight the differences in the explorer whilst developing the filing structure.

**Pre-optimised Layout**

This is the pre-optimised layout. Many of the functions were contained in app.js. The file pre-modularisation was harder to maintain. Hundreds of lines of code in one file became harder to track.

**Post-optimised Layout**

We solved this problem by splitting the functions in app into smaller chunks, making it more maintainable. We kept app.js as the file that would wire everything together. Think of it as a default project file, or the central node, like a web.

## Simple Import Library Feature

- The library assets can be found in the control panel. Currently, a simple drop down menu system is used. After selecting the desired OBJ model, you can import it by clicking import.

## Updated Gizmo

- As seen in the previous image, the Gizmo was contained in a visible box. However, to reduce the visual overload, we got rid of the box, and kept the Gizmo in the scene, with the ability to see behind the Gizmo as to not disrupt the scene.
- Moreover, we added negative X, Y, Z values to indicate the angle of the viewport. The shorter arrows indicate the negative direction, whilst the larger arrows indicate the positive direction.
