Our goal for today is mainly testing. A lot of the main functions have been implemented, but we want to ensure the integrity of our application is intact. That being said, we will document any bugs, issues, or features that could be fixed.

## Issues Discovered (Manual Testing)

1. Scaling does not always work. It seems to be camera angle dependent.
2. Left/right click both moves object, we need to fix mixed inputs.
3. Export doesn't work for the scene (only select OBJ objects).
4. Navbar currently serves no purpose (YAGNI), so we should add user manual icon.
5. Lack of X,Y,Z grid line indicators make it hard to tell what direction you're facing, unless you look at the Gizmo.
6. Overlapping transform arrows/rings/squares on objects do not work, and object is selected instead. We need to give arrows priority.
7. Highlight OBJ feature could be implemented to select multiple OBJ. (As indicated in issue 1, we could use right click multi select to highlight obj)
8. Loading import library could be optimised for speed, as loading OBJ causes lag.
9. Object list empty-state is referenced in JS but not present in the HTML, so users never see an “empty list” message.
10. Component splitting only targets the first mesh inside a group, so multi-mesh imports won’t split all parts.
11. Split component currently logs a lot of debug output to the console, which can slow down or clutter real usage.
12. Multi-file OBJ imports are processed sequentially, which makes large batch imports feel sluggish.
13. Undo has no redo path, so users can’t step forward after an undo.
