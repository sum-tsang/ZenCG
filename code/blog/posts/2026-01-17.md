## Files

Our editor/src directory currently contains these JavaScript files. Each containing a specific function. After the last changes, we implemented quite a few features, namely model transformation, action history (undo), import multiple OBJ files

### App

editor/src/
- app.js

### Camera

editor/src/camera/
- camera.js
- cameraSettings.js
- orbit.js
- pan.js
- zoom.js

### History

editor/src/history/
- actionHistory.js
- undo.js

### IO

editor/src/io
- export.js
- import.js

### Model Transformation

editor/src/modelTransformation/
- example.js
- gizmo.js
- manager.js
- panel.js

### Model Transformation

The fundamental transformation logic is encapsulated within gizmo.js, which offers an interactive 3D gizmo designed for translation, rotation, and scaling through axis-based handles that provide clear visual feedback and facilitate constrained manipulation.

Mouse interactions rely on raycasting for selecting handles and plane-based dragging to guarantee smooth and predictable transformations, using camera-facing planes for scaling and axis-perpendicular planes for rotation.

Camera navigation and model editing are intentionally distinct, with left-click designated for camera control and right-click reserved for transformations, incorporating multiple safeguards to avert accidental modifications.

The scaling process has been enhanced to eliminate jitter by implementing exponential scaling based on mouse movement from the initial click point, as opposed to relying on incremental frame deltas.

panel.js offers precise numerical control through per-axis inputs that are synchronized with the gizmo, while manager.js coordinates bidirectional updates between the two interfaces and prevents feedback loops.

In combination, the visual gizmo and numerical panel facilitate both intuitive and precise workflows within a cohesive system.

### Undo

- Implemented undo function (Ctrl + Z)

Implemented undo, using a snapshot-based stack, by tracking transforms. We track the position, rotation, and scale. Snapshots are currently stored per-object, so when you click on a new object, the history is no longer tracked. This avoids confusion between objects.

The user can click Ctrl+Z on their keyboard (standard commands used on computers) to execute undo. Float-epsilon fail-safe to make sure that it detects changes with an actual difference.

### IndexedDB

- Implemented multiple obj persistance

When we first implemented import, we only accounted for one obj, however, upon testing the features, we reloaded the app only for one obj to remain. If you imported multiple, and reloaded the application, only one obj would remain loaded, whilst other obj were cleared. Stored data now keeps all imported files, so leaving the workspace does not clear your project.

We did this by storing a list of data, and reloading every entry upon launching application.


### Multi-File Import

- Implemented multiple obj file import

You can now import multiple files into the project. The file input supports multiple OBJ files now. However, importing leads to files being stacked on top of eachother (loading in the same position), making it difficult to select, so we introducted offsetting newly imported files on the x-axis.

### UI

The basis of ZenCG is to make 3D editing accessible, thus we introduced clear UI to indicate action history, list of OBJ files in the environment, and active highlighting of selected models for clarity.

## What next?

There is a lot of cleaning up to do. The features implemented are not full-proof and may have erros or not work as intended.

We shall test the features, make sure everything works smoothly, and tie up any loose ends. We will document any bugs found in the future.
