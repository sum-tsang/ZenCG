## Files

Our editor/src directory currently contains these JavaScript files. Each containing a specific function. After the last changes, we implemented quite a few features, namely model transformation, action history (undo), import multiple OBJ files

### App

- gizmo.js
- manager.js
- panel.js

### Model Transformation

The fundamental transformation logic is encapsulated within gizmo.js, which offers an interactive 3D gizmo designed for translation, rotation, and scaling through axis-based handles that provide clear visual feedback and facilitate constrained manipulation.

Mouse interactions rely on raycasting for selecting handles and plane-based dragging to guarantee smooth and predictable transformations, using camera-facing planes for scaling and axis-perpendicular planes for rotation.

Camera navigation and model editing are intentionally distinct, with left-click designated for camera control and right-click reserved for transformations, incorporating multiple safeguards to avert accidental modifications.

The scaling process has been enhanced to eliminate jitter by implementing exponential scaling based on mouse movement from the initial click point, as opposed to relying on incremental frame deltas.

panel.js offers precise numerical control through per-axis inputs that are synchronized with the gizmo, while manager.js coordinates bidirectional updates between the two interfaces and prevents feedback loops.

In combination, the visual gizmo and numerical panel facilitate both intuitive and precise workflows within a cohesive system.

### Undo

Implemented undo, using a snapshot-based stack. Action history is tracked, and is displayed in the panel, allowing user to see recent actions. Ctrl+Z (standard commands used on computers) to execute undo.

### IndexedDB
