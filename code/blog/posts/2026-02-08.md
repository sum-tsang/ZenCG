# UI Refresh

## Changes

Rather than disjoint islands, the control panels are now seamlessly integrated into the sides of the page. A toggle feature has been added, to allow users to collapse the panels for further screen real estate. White text provides clarity against the glassy backdrop. Input fields and buttons are darkened to contrast well with the colours of the panel.

## Features Added

- Object management panel: object list, rename field, and multi-select outlines.
- Transform panel upgrades: mode buttons with units, Create Component (split) flow, and action history list.
- Import/export improvements: MTL-aware import, custom export filenames, and exporting MTL + textures.
- User Manual now opens as a focused, splash-style modal with quick tips and a clear close action.
- Tools panel overflow fixes ensure unit labels (e.g., `m`) and inputs stay within the panel.
- Added an editor quick reference (`code/editor/README.md`) that highlights core features and shortcuts.
