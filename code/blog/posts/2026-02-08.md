## Changes

Rather than disjoint islands, the control panels are now seamlessly integrated into the sides of the page. A toggle feature has been added, to allow users to collapse the panels for further screen real estate. White text provides clarity against the glassy backdrop. Input fields and buttons are darkened to contrast well with the colours of the panel.
