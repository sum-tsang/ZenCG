### Moved + Enlarged Environment Gizmo 

- Moved Gizmo away from the control panel to balance visual weight.
- Enlarged to make labels clearer, and to be more visible.
- Gizmo has equal sized arrows now (cohesive re-design).

### Blurred UI/Control Panel + Seperated Panels

- Glassmorphic design (negligible performance impact) to reduce visual clutter. Softer design allows beginners to get easier feel of the viewport rather than have a whole section of the screen blocked.
- It is the same concept, taken from the inspiration of how people make rooms seem bigger with mirrors.
- Separated panels for clear sectioning of functionality.
- TRANSFORM buttons are now icons rather than text.
- Import OBJ moved back down to be near import/export sections.

### Reflection

We made significant 'quality of life' improvements to our application. Shortcuts were added, persistance for colours and textures were added. Undo deleted OBJ is now supported, X, Z axis grid lines added, and the grid was made larger. The viewport view distance was increased, so you can see farther away objects now. Still a lot to fix, like UI spacing, re-fixing GIZMO, getting clear on controls + shortcuts.
