# ZenCG Blog

Hello, we have set up a basic blog, utilising markdown format. We will document our software engineering process, development processes and major design decisions. The blog will be publicly accessible, and will likely be hosted on render. We chose the markdown format due to the nature of the project, and as previous requirements required markdown.
