## Overview

We had a meeting with our supervisor today. We were given good advice regarding the blog. He suggested we utilise images to show the progression of our project, so reviewers can have a better grasp of our thought processes. Attached below is our current editor user interface. It hasn't largely changed from the beginning of our project, but to highlight what we did change so you can understand, imagine the control panel being empty, aside from a simple import and export feature. As we developed our project, we added more and more functionality / features in the control panel.

Regarding the design of our user interface, it mightn't look super cohesive or usable, that is because we are not focusing on the aesthetics yet... we are focusing on developing the core functions so our application can actually run! However, we have a basic gizmo working, a basic viewport, and some simple controls.

### Basic Editor UI

### Basic Home UI

We are treating *ZenCG* like a real product that people will use. We have set up a basic 'index.html' home page at the root (code/), to emulate this. We want to convert people who are interested in our project, into real users, which is done by capturing their attention, highlighting our unique value propositions, and placing multiple call-to-actions that will lead them directly to the editor.

As you can see, utilsing Tailwind CSS has allowed for smooth prototyping, allowing us to have a feel of our website. We are crystalising our vision for what *ZenCG* could be.

## Tailwind CSS for UI/UX

For simplicity, we will be using Tailwind CSS rather than a custom style.css file.

## Supervisor Meeting

**Progress and comments**

```
Students have made great progress.
Editor up at:
https://zencg.onrender.com/editor/
Can import OBJ, view using Three.js, make basic transforms, export.

Sticking to OBJ and MTL is fine. Plenty of work to do with those. 

Suggest "choose file from server" function with library of useful OBJs.

One question: How about user testing?
```

**Deliverables**

```
Students are working on the hard parts - select part of OBJ and transform it,
create new OBJ from multiple parts

Any way of implementing advanced functions is fine. 
Can use menus to help. It does not have to be all mouse driven.

Suggest a demo / run through in 1 week or 10 days and see where we are.
```

As highlighted, our supervisor has set us clear targets/deliverables. As the meeting is fresh on the top of our minds, it would be wise to instantly implement the advice given.

- Choose file from server function, with library of useful OBJs.
- Our web app actually encourages 'tutorials', so could the 'demo' instead be a prototype for our 'integrated tutorials' functionality?
