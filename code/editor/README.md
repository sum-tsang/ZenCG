# ZenCG Editor — Quick Reference

## Core Functionality
- Import OBJ (and MTL references) via the Import button or the Model Library.
- Manage objects in the list: select, rename, and delete.
- Transform tools with precise numeric inputs (translate in meters, rotate in degrees, scale as a multiplier).
- Create Component (split) workflow for creating separate inside/outside parts.
- Material controls: base color picker, hex input, texture upload, and texture removal.
- Export the selected object or the entire scene with a custom filename.
- Action history list for recent edits.
- User Manual overlay accessible from the User Manual button.

## Typical Workflow
- Import an OBJ.
- Select it from the Objects list.
- Use the transform panel or numeric inputs to adjust position, rotation, or scale.

- Export the selected object or entire scene.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
- `G` — Translate
- `R` — Rotate
- `S` — Scale
- `Delete` / `Backspace` — Delete selected object
- `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `Z` — Undo last transform (and undo delete when applicable)

## Tips
- Use numeric inputs for precise transforms.
- The Create Component tool guides you with on-panel hints; cancel if needed.
